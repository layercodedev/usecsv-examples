## UseCSV js plugin demo


### Getting started

see @usecsv/js usage in `src/main.js`

**Running the app locally:**

3. Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

**scripts:**  

- `yarn build` builds the application to `public/bundle.js`, along with a sourcemap file for debugging.

- `yarn start` launches a server, using [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve). Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

- `yarn watch` will continually rebuild the application as your source files change.
